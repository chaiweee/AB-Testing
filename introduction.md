# A/B Testing

## What is A/B Testing?  

A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process, wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drives business metrics.  
At its most basic, is a way to compare two versions of something to figure out which performs better.  
While it’s most often associated with websites and apps, Fung says the method is almost 100 years old.  

## Why should we use A/B Testing?  
If B2B businesses today are unhappy with all the unqualified leads they get per month, eCommerce stores, on the other hand, are struggling with a high cart abandonment rate.  
Meanwhile, media and publishing houses are also dealing with low viewer engagement.  
These core conversion metrics are affected by some common problems like leaks in the conversion funnel, drop-offs on the payment page, etc.

1. Solve visitor pain points  
Visitors come to your website to achieve a specific goal that they have in mind. It may be to understand more about your product or service, buy a particular product, read/learn more about a specific topic, or simply browse.  
Whatever the visitor’s goal may be, they may face some common pain points while achieving their goal. It can be a confusing copy or hard to find the CTA button like buy now, request a demo, etc.  
Not being able to achieve their goals leads to a bad user experience. This increases friction and eventually impacts your conversion rates. Use data gathered through visitor behavior analysis tools such as heatmaps, Google Analytics, and website surveys to solve your visitors’ pain points.  
This stands true for all businesses: eCommerce, travel, SaaS, education, media, and publishing.  

2. Get better ROI from existing traffic  
As most experience optimizers have come to realize, the cost of acquiring quality traffic on your website is huge.  
A/B testing lets you make the most out of your existing traffic and helps you increase conversions without having to spend additional dollars on acquiring new traffic.  
A/B testing can give you high ROI as sometimes, even the minutest of changes on your website can result in a significant increase in overall business conversions.  

3. Reduce bounce rate  
One of the most important metrics to track to judge your website’s performance is its bounce rate.  
There may be many reasons behind your website’s high bounce rate, such as too many options to choose from, expectations mismatch, confusing navigation, use of too much technical jargon, and so on.  
Since different websites serve different goals and cater to different segments of audiences, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to reducing bounce rate.  
However, running an A/B test can prove beneficial. With A/B testing, you can test multiple variations of an element of your website till you find the best possible version. This not only helps you find friction and visitor pain points but helps improve your website visitors’ overall experience, making them spend more time on your site and even converting into a paying customer.  

4. Make low-risk modifications  
Make minor, incremental changes to your web page with A/B testing instead of getting the entire page redesigned. This can reduce the risk of jeopardizing your current conversion rate.  
A/B testing lets you target your resources for maximum output with minimal modifications, resulting in an increased ROI. An example of that could be product description changes.  
You can perform an A/B test when you plan to remove or update your product descriptions. You do not know how your visitors are going to react to the change.  
By running an A/B test, you can analyze their reaction and ascertain which side the weighing scale may tilt.  
Another example of low-risk modification can be the introduction of a new feature change. Before introducing a new feature, launching it as an A/B test can help you understand whether or not the new change that you’re suggesting will please your website audience.  
Implementing a change on your website without testing it may or may not pay off in both the short and long run. Testing and then making changes can make the outcome more certain.

5. Achieve statistically significant improvements  
Since A/B testing is entirely data-driven with no room for guesswork, gut feelings, or instincts, you can quickly determine a “winner” and a “loser” based on statistically significant improvements on metrics like time spent on the page, number of demo requests, cart abandonment rate, click-through rate, and so on.

6. Redesign website to increase future business gains  
Redesigning can range from a minor CTA[^1] text or color tweak to particular web pages to completely revamping the website.  
The decision to implement one version or the other should always be data-driven when A/B testing.  
Do not quit testing with the design being finalized. As the new version goes live, test other web page elements to ensure that the most engaging version is served to the visitors.

[^1]: CTA (Call-to-action)  
The CTA is where all the real action takes place – whether or not visitors finish their purchases and convert if they fill out the sign-up form or not, and more such actions that have a direct bearing on your conversion rate.  
A/B testing enables you to test different CTA copies, their placement across the web page, toy with their size and color scheme, and so on.  
Such experimentation helps understand which variation has the potential to get the most conversions.  

## What are the different types of A/B Tests?  

### 1. Split URL Testing  
Many people in the testing arena confuse Split URL testing with A/B testing. However, the two are fundamentally very different.  
Split URL testing refers to an experimentation process wherein an entirely new version of an existing web page URL is tested to analyze which one performs better.  
Example of Split URL testing:  
<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-07 at 10 10 48 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125619716/230520343-cf361c89-14e9-480c-a04b-8285b78273f5.png">  

Typically, A/B testing is used when you wish to only test front-end changes on your website.  
On the other hand, Split URL testing is used when you wish to make significant changes to your existing page, especially in terms of design. You’re not willing to touch the existing web page design for comparison purposes.   
When you run a Split URL test, your website traffic is split between the control (original web page URL) and variations (new web page URL), and each of their respective conversion rates is measured to decide the winner.  

**Advantages of Split URL testing**  
- Ideal for trying out radical new designs while using the existing page design for comparative analysis.  
- Recommended for running tests with non-UI changes, such as switching to a different database, optimizing your page’s load time, etc.  
- Change up web page workflows. Workflows dramatically affect business conversions, helping test new paths before implementing changes and determine if any of the sticking points were missed.  
- A better and much-recommended testing method for dynamic content.

### 2. Multivariate testing (MVT)  
Multivariate testing (MVT) refers to an experimentation method wherein variations of multiple page variables are simultaneously tested to analyze which combination of variables perform the best out of all the possible permutations.  
It’s more complicated than a regular A/B test and is best suited for advanced marketing, product, and development professionals.  
Example of MVT testing:  
<img width="743" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-07 at 10 13 52 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125619716/230520595-a1ed062d-637b-473a-888d-c70c6658abad.png">  

Here’s an example to give you a more comprehensive description of multivariate testing.  
Let’s say you decide to test 2 versions, each of the hero image, call-to-action button color, and headlines of one of your landing pages.  
This means a total of 8 variations are created, which will be concurrently tested to find the winning variation.  
Here’s a simple formula to calculate the total number of versions in a multivariate test:  
```
[No. of variations of element A] x [No. of variations of element B] x [No. of variations of element C]… = [Total No. of variations]
```
When conducted properly, multivariate testing can help eliminate the need to run multiple and sequential A/B tests on a web page with similar goals.  
Running concurrent tests with a greater number of variations helps you save time, money, and efforts and come to a conclusion in the shortest possible time.

**Advantages of Multivariate testing**  
Multivariate testing typically offers primary three benefits:  
- Helps avoid the need to conduct several sequential A/B tests with the same goal and saves time since you can simultaneously track the performance of various tested page elements.  
- Easily analyze and determine the contribution of each page element to the measured gains.  
- Map all the interaction between all independent element variations (page headlines, banner image, etc.).

### 3. Multipage testing  
Multipage testing is a form of experimentation where you can test changes to particular elements across multiple pages.  

Example of multipage testing:  
<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-07 at 10 23 57 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125619716/230521516-dee7944f-7ebc-46e8-8154-d1a9121a1b44.png">  

There are two ways to conduct a multipage test.  
One, you can either take all the pages of your sales funnel and create new versions of each, which makes your challenger the sales funnel, and you then test it against the control. This is called Funnel Multipage testing.  
Two, you can test how the addition or removal of the recurring element(s), such as security badges, testimonials, etc., can impact conversions across an entire funnel. This is called Classic or Conventional Multipage testing.  

**Advantages of Multipage testing**  
Similar to A/B testing, Multipage testing is easy to create and run and provides meaningful and reliable data with ease and in the shortest possible time.  
The advantage of multipage testing are as follows:  
- It enables you to create consistent experiences for your target audience. 
- It helps your target audience see a consistent set of pages, no matter if it’s the control or one of its variations. 
- It enables you to implement the same change on several pages to ensure that your website visitors don’t get distracted and bounce off between different variations and designs when navigating through your website.
